    "An **interaction manager** generates or updates the presentation by processing user inputs, session context and possibly other external knowledge sources to determine the intent of the user.

    "Some of the ways we can improve our interaction with the system is feeeding more **Effort/Motion Factors** beyond the Space and Time that were considered here.
