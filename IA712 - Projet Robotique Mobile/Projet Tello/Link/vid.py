# Allows experimenting with video stream in OpenCV under temperature control
# and battery monitoring.
#
# Adapted from: https://github.com/robagar/tello-asyncio/blob/main/examples/video_opencv.py
# Modified by Helge Hackbarth and provided under the same conditions as the
# original file.
#
# The OpenCV UI must run in the main thread, so the drone control runs in a
# worker thread with its own asyncio event loop.
#
# Please note:
#   - If OpenCV fails to capture any video it gives up without showing the
#     window
#   - The video may lag a few seconds behind the live action, but it should
#     keep up with the live stream after some seconds
